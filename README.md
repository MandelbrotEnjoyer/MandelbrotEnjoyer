For many years I have been interested in STEM related topics. This interest pushed me into learning many skills that I am currently trying to develop and use in student research clubs. 
Over the years, in parallel to my STEM interest, I developed skills such as: Creating 3D visualizations, Video Editing and 2D Graphics Design.
